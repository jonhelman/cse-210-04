## Description
As Michael Douglas's character in the 1987 movie "Wall Street" famously said "Greed, for the lack of a better word, is good." Because this game is about getting rewarded for your greed. Take control of your character as you try to catch gems falling from the sky as much as you can while avoiding rocks that can reduce your score. There is no game over, collect gems as much as long as you want even if you get a negative score!
